Hi, I'm Katya. I'm 23 years old and I live in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

Current occupation: surfing the web, writing stuff, sometimes even code. Contributing to open-source projects.

Studying. I spend a lot of time learning different things, mostly R (and statistics) and Python. I've learned a lot (A LOT), and, what I'm personally proud of, I finish courses at Coursera:
