Hi, I'm Katya and this is my blog.

## About me ##

Location: Saint Petersburg, Russia.

Current occupation: surfing the web, writing stuff, sometimes even code. Studying. I spend a lot of time learning different things, mostly R (and statistics) and Python. I can't tell if I've *learned* a lot, but at least I finish courses at Coursera:
