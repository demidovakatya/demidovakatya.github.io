Hi, I'm Katya. I'm 23 years old and I live in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

Current occupation: surfing the web, writing stuff, . 

Contributing to open source projects.

Studying.

I spend a lot of time learning different things, mostly R/Python for statistics and machine learning. I've learned a lot, and, what I'm personally proud of, developed a habit to finish online courses (did you know that completion rate for MOOCs is about 15-20%? not for me!).



Geez I'm a nerd.
