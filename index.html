  <!-- <h1 class="page-heading">My awesome blog</h1> -->

  <p>{{ site.description }}</p>

  <p class="intro-post-list">Though I don't add new texts to this blog as often as I wish I did, I do write from time to time. Since I live in Russia, there are posts in Russian, not only in English. And since I enjoy data science, programming, random funny stuff from the web and psychology (this was unexpected, I guess), I mostly write about programming. :D</p>

  <p class="intro-post-list">And here are my <strong>recent posts</strong>:</p>

  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <div class="post-preview">
      <p><a class="post-link" href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ post.title }}</a> <span class="post-meta">{{ post.date | date: "%d/%m/%Y" }}</span></p>
    </div>
