To begin with, I'm 24 now, yay!

I've been doing stuff, learning, thinking, and doing stuff again for the whole year.

* For example, I've been contributing to github for 6 months now. 
* And I'm employed now!
* And there are some programming assignments on Coursera I have to fix a little...

Everything is awesome, I just wish I had some free time for, you know, _taking food_. And I'm not talking about sleeping â€“ because sleep is for the weak.
