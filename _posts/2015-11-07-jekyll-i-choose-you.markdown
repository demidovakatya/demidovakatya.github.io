I've find this post in my `_posts` directory. God bless the [Jekyll’s GitHub repo](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) for this awesome *static site generator*.

Finally...

I tried to make a blog with [Hexo](https://hexo.io) a couple of days ago, but I quickly understood that this framework wasn't an option for me. The main reason was that **Hexo** documentation was difficult for me to understand. I'm not a programmer, you know! More than that, English is not my mother~~fucking~~ language ~~do I speak it?!~~. That's why things like **generate** and **deploy** looked like Castor and Pollux to me – yeh, wow, cool, but what's the difference.

Secondly, **Hexo** is not as popular as **Jekyll**. And audience means a lot: people ask questions, people give answers, people make plugins and themes, people create issues and fix bugs. A project is not going to be improved by itself. 

## Now what?

Being honest, this blog is created with no purpose other than fulfilling my need in verbal vomiting. And (yay!) this astounding purpose is achieved.

I'll write something reasonable next time.
