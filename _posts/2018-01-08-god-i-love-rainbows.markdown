How often do you get sad, or frustrated, or just bored by your everyday programming routines? Once in eternity? Rarely? Or every other day?

Irregardless of your answer, I want to show you some nice tools/plugins/pieces of software that can add some rainbows to your working environment. Inb4: no homo.

## `lolcat`

`[lolcat](https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat/)` is a tiny library written in Ruby and it is freaking awesome. To begin with, it has [a Python port](https://github.com/tehmaze/lolcat). 

Let's install the stable version and run something with *lolcat*:

```bash
pip install lolcat

lolcat --help | lolcat 
```

## Nyan Cat Progress Bars

If you use Google Chrome, [Stylish](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en-US) is a must! And, I guess, you watch YouTube sometimes – oh, we all do sometimes – so bring Nyan Cat to the videohosting with [this custom progress bar](https://userstyles.org/styles/95033/youtube-nyan-cat-progress-bar-video-player-theme). Please keep in mind that this style works with HTML5 player only.

Unluckily, `[nyanbar](https://github.com/apg/nyanbar)` is broken, `[nyancat](https://github.com/taizilongxu/nyancat)` looks useless, so does `[nyan_logger](https://github.com/tomhennigan/nyan_logger)`. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

But there is a really, *really* awesome thing out there in the web – and I am talking about [Nyan Cat prograss bar for IDEA](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8575-nyan-progress-bar) (also compatible with PhpStorm, WebStorm, PyCharm, RubyMine, AppCode, CLion, GoLand, DataGrip, Rider, MPS, and Android Studio).
