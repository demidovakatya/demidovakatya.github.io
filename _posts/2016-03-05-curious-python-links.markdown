These _precious_ Reddit and Twitter bots are from my Safari Reading List. I've added some interesting and/or useful pieces of Python code. So, when you are in the mood for coding but too bored to even think of something serious, you can just choose any of these:

## Twitter

https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1j89l9/tutorial_basic_twitter_bot/ — "This was a small project I did to teach myself the Twitter API, Github, EC2 (Amazon servers), crontab and of course to get better at Python. This tutorial assumes you are using OSX and know how to use the terminal" (by [/u/bert720](https://www.reddit.com/user/bert720)).

https://github.com/strizhechenko/zaebot – 18+

http://theburningmonk.github.io/RandomArtsBot/ – This project implements a Twitter bot ([@RandomArtsBot](https://twitter.com/randomartsbot)) that generates random art using your message. To test it out, send a message to the bot using the following syntax.

http://blog.ventolin.org/posts/grammer_man-who-the-fuck-is-this-nigga-and-why-u-comin-at-me-like-that-hoeassnigga.html — His name is [@Grammer_Man](https://twitter.com/Grammer_Man) and he corrects other twitter users' misspellings, using data scraped from these Wikipedia pages.

## Reddit 

https://github.com/Antrikshy/reddit2Kindle – Compiles text posts from your favorite story-based subreddits for easy reading on Kindle devices and apps.

https://github.com/papernotes/Reddit-OriginalPostSearcher – A Reddit bot that aims to comment with the original submission of an xpost.

https://github.com/powderblock/DealWithItReddit – DealWithItReddit is the backbone to a reddit bot that finds faces and eyes in images. When a pair of eyes are found within a face, a pair of "Deal With it" glasses are added.

https://github.com/renfredxh/compilebot – CompileBot is a reddit bot that can execute source code in comments. All you have to do is mention CompileBot in your comments along with a language and source code.

## Extra

http://matthewearl.github.io/2015/07/28/switching-eds-with-python/ – "In this post I’ll describe how I wrote a short (200 line) Python script to automatically replace facial features on an image of a face, with the facial features from a second image of a face".

## And A Question

> I've mainly used python for basic task automation at work (I'm a network engineer). I'm wondering what modules should every python developer be good with? Are there common ones that everyone should know how to use? I mean more than just sys, time, etc...
