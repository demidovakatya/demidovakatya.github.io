Yesterday, I took my Mac, made some coffee, and started learning statistics. And 10 hours later, I can tell sigma and standard error apart (and standard deviation! and se! and sd! and sigma-hat! and... sd... or se... err, statisticians, why don't you increase variability in used words and/or letters).

List of nice courses:

* [Intro to Descriptive Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-descriptive-statistics--ud827) and
* [Intro to Inferential Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-inferential-statistics--ud201) on Udacity. These courses can be understood by anyone – kids, newborns, cats, slow and dumb people, lazy people, those who are allergic to formulas with `sqrt()` in the denominator… it's very comprehensible, really. 
* [Basic Statistics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/basic-statistics/home/welcome) is more compelling, especially after descriptive statistics.

That's all by now, actually. These three are very helpful for anyone who can't put all that statistics into mind!
